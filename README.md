Health centers are very different from free clinics. The two differ in many ways. Health centers receive some of its funding from federal and other grants, government healthcare programs, and insurance payments. Free clinics are funded by private investments and donations. Health centers are staffed by employees hired with quality standards and experience, while free clinics are in most cases staffed by volunteers providing quality care. Health centers are strictly directed by a board with at least 51% community patient members. Free clinic boards vary and may not be majority-lead by community patients.</div>
      <div class="col-sm-4"><h5 style="color: green;"> THE PURPOSE OF HEALTH CENTERS</h5>
There’s a lot of things a health center is, and a lot of things that a health center is not. It can get confusing, and difficult to remember all the details.<br>
The main point is, community health centers are driven by patients, for patients. They accommodate patients’ unique needs and do their best to help them overcome obstacles to high-quality healthcare. Most importantly, they make healthcare affordable, accessible, and adequate.</div>
        <div class="col-sm-4"><h5 style="color: green;">A SPECIALIST DOCTOR’S OFFICE</h5>
Different from general physicians, specialist doctors usually don’t provide the first line of defense against health issues. After seeing a general physician, he or she might refer you to a specialist to take a deeper dive and receive their expert care. For instance, if you have skin issues, you may get referred to a dermatologist for treatment.
While health centers have both doctors and dentists, they generally do not have specialist doctors in-house. In this case, health centers will refer you to trusted specialists that can treat patients with their insurance coverage — or lack thereof. Some Health Centers may provide specialty care like podiatry.</div>

  <p>What is mind health?
Mind health is a balanced mental and emotional state which allows a person to be productive during their day, contributing meaningfully to the community they live in. When the balance is disrupted, it can be difficult to function positively. Coping with life stresses can become challenging and activities, that at other times may have seemed easy, can now seem daunting. There are a number of factors that can affect a person’s mind health, such as a traumatic experience or a physical illness. When a person’s mind health is negatively affected, how they think and feel is also influenced, in turn impacting on how they function on a day-to-day basis.  On the other hand, when our mind health is good, we are able to flourish and engage in the activities that are meaningful for us. It is therefore important that we gain mastery over our mind by:<br>
<ul>
<li>Being aware of thoughts and emotions, and how they affect us</li>
<li>Recognising and having healthy ways to cope with stressors when they arise</li>
<li>Having strong relationships with people who are important in our lives</li>
<li>Regularly doing things that are meaningful and reflective of our values (e.g. fun, health or community)
When mind health becomes overwhelmingly negative, professional help is often necessary. Active+ Mental Health professionals work with clients to provide education and support surrounding mind health. They help clients deal with trauma and learn coping strategies in order to improve their psychological state and well-being.</li></ul></p>

  <p>What is a “healthy lifestyle”?
Ask 50 people to define what a “healthy lifestyle” is, and you’ll likely get 50 different answers. That’s because there’s no one way to be healthy. A healthy lifestyle simply means doing things that make you happy and feel good.<br><br>

For one person, that may mean walking a mile five times a week, eating fast food once a week, and spending virtual or in-person time with loved ones every other day. For someone else, a healthy lifestyle may be training and running two marathons a year, following a keto diet, and never having a sip of alcohol.<br><br>

Neither of these is better than the other. Both are perfect for that person. You get to decide what your healthy lifestyle looks like.</p>
